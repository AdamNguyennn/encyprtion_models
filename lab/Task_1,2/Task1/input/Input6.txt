 

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention. It is not only the most important factors crucial to the development and survival of a nation, a territory but a junction of trade between regions of countries, cultures on world together. In advanced countries, the situation and development of their traffic is quite developed with a dense transport network and is regulated, but in Vietnam, … Urban transport situation in Vietnam is extremely chaotic.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

As a senior high school student, I am very busy with my studies. Although I am very fond of watching television, I can only spend an hour after dinner on my hobby.

Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that.

It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Hanoi is famous for typical tropical seasoned place of SouthEast Asia with four seasons: fresh, green and cool in Spring, a bit hot in Summer, fine in the fall and cold in Winter. One things makes my hometown special is that you can meet both contemporary and classical architecture right in the city center. Beside many buildings and shopping center, you can see historical places such as Tran Quoc Pagoda, Hoa Lo Prison, Temple Literature,… Moreover, street food can be found on the main streets of Hanoi, and down many of the side streets and alleyways. You have to try some of the most popular foods in Hanoi, such as: Noodle, Rolled cake, West Lake shrimp cake,… However, one of the main downsides of Hanoi is environmental problems such as air pollution, caused by heavy traffic. Therefore, government builds many parks and plants trees. I love my hometown very much because it is an interesting place to live.
As a senior high school student, I am very busy with my studies. Although I am very fond of watching television, I can only spend an hour after dinner on my hobby. Of all the TV programs, I like the news and documentaries best. The news programs shown on all TV channels at 7:00 p.m. help me to update almost everything about different places in our country and important events happening all over the world. Through these programs, I can also know about the main national and international sporting events. The documentary programs at weekends are my favorites. By watching them, I can learn a great deal about human civilizations, the wonders of nature and the amazing inventions and discoveries of great people in the world. Watching television is my hobby. I cannot imagine a day in my life without watching it.
I usually get up at 7 o'clock in the morning. After washing my face and brushing my teeth, I do morning exercises for ten minutes. Then I have breakfast with my dad at 7:20 and leave home for school at 7:40. My classes start at 8:00 and end at 11:30. After that I come back home, and have lunch with my family at 12:00.

I come back home and have dinner at 7:00 p.m. After dinner, I often watch the news on TV for thirty minutes. Then I prepare for the new lessons and go to bed at 10:30 p.m.
Today, in Vietnam often faced with many natural disasters such as floods, droughts, hail, tropical storms and other natural disasters. These are the most frightening things people are concerned about. Tropical storms often occur and cause most harm. It usually occurs in the rainy season and occurs most often in central Vietnam and coastal areas. It causes a lot of damage to people and property. First, killing people, livestock and poultry by the flood. Second, crop loss due to flooding. Humans become homeless and lose all their possessions. and many other damages caused by the storm. To prevent and fight against tropical storms, before it takes place, we must make preventive dikes, prepare adequate tools and food and other necessities. When storms occur, people must find safe shelters not to go out. After that, we have to overcome what hurricanes destroy, such as rebuilding houses, and many other things, if we live in that area, we should plant trees, protect the environment and many other practical things.
Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that. The 23rd day of the last Lunar month is East Day—a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong). It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien). After that, till the third day or even the fourth day of Tet, individuals meet relatives, friends, and colleagues, wishing them all kinds of good things like happiness, health, and success.
Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.
Each person must have the ideal partner for themselves. For me, my ideal partner is a good heart, honesty, and respect parents, hardworking, and educated. Moreover, she is also a pretty and attractive woman.
Firstly, I love my ideal partner very much because she is enough clever to keep my heart cheerful and always helps me when I need her, especially in my studies.
Besides that, my girlfriend is good heart and responsible when she always reminds me that education is very important because that is what determines our future.Therefore I have to put my education first and when I have problems in studying, we can share with each other to solve together. Last but not least, my woman always respect my parents by greeting them, asking them whenever she helping them in some situations.
For my conclusion, when we want to choose the ideal partner for us, we must know the background of her life and characteristics so that we can choose a suitable lover in the future.
When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention. It is not only the most important factors crucial to the development and survival of a nation, a territory but a junction of trade between regions of countries, cultures on world together. In advanced countries, the situation and development of their traffic is quite developed with a dense transport network and is regulated, but in Vietnam, … Urban transport situation in Vietnam is extremely chaotic. On average there are thousands of cases every year in traffic accidents, causing serious loss of life and property. Despite being upgraded and renovated several times but the transport system of Vietnam has not improved as much. Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.

You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

As a senior high school student, I am very busy with my studies. Although I am very fond of watching television, I can only spend an hour after dinner on my hobby. Of all the TV programs, I like the news and documentaries best. The news programs shown on all TV channels at 7:00 p.m. help me to update almost everything about different places in our country and important events happening all over the world.

It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park.

I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites.

My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time.

Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her.

She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

As a senior high school student, I am very busy with my studies. Although I am very fond of watching television, I can only spend an hour after dinner on my hobby. Of all the TV programs, I like the news and documentaries best. The news programs shown on all TV channels at 7:00 p.m. help me to update almost everything about different places in our country and important events happening all over the world.

Today, in Vietnam often faced with many natural disasters such as floods, droughts, hail, tropical storms and other natural disasters. These are the most frightening things people are concerned about. Tropical storms often occur and cause most harm. It usually occurs in the rainy season and occurs most often in central Vietnam and coastal areas. It causes a lot of damage to people and property. First, killing people, livestock and poultry by the flood. Second, crop loss due to flooding. Humans become homeless and lose all their possessions. and many other damages caused by the storm.

Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that.

It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.
Each person must have the ideal partner for themselves. For me, my ideal partner is a good heart, honesty, and respect parents, hardworking, and educated. Moreover, she is also a pretty and attractive woman.

Last but not least, my woman always respect my parents by greeting them, asking them whenever she helping them in some situations.
For my conclusion, when we want to choose the ideal partner for us, we must know the background of her life and characteristics so that we can choose a suitable lover in the future.
When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

As a senior high school student, I am very busy with my studies. Although I am very fond of watching television, I can only spend an hour after dinner on my hobby. Of all the TV programs, I like the news and documentaries best. The news programs shown on all TV channels at 7:00 p.m. help me to update almost everything about different places in our country and important events happening all over the world. Through these programs, I can also know about the main national and international sporting events. The documentary programs at weekends are my favorites.

Today, in Vietnam often faced with many natural disasters such as floods, droughts, hail, tropical storms and other natural disasters. These are the most frightening things people are concerned about. Tropical storms often occur and cause most harm. It usually occurs in the rainy season and occurs most often in central Vietnam and coastal areas. It causes a lot of damage to people and property. First, killing people, livestock and poultry by the flood. Second, crop loss due to flooding. Humans become homeless and lose all their possessions. and many other damages caused by the storm.

Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that. The 23rd day of the last Lunar month is East Day—a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong). It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.
Each person must have the ideal partner for themselves. For me, my ideal partner is a good heart, honesty, and respect parents, hardworking, and educated. Moreover, she is also a pretty and attractive woman.

Last but not least, my woman always respect my parents by greeting them, asking them whenever she helping them in some situations.
For my conclusion, when we want to choose the ideal partner for us, we must know the background of her life and characteristics so that we can choose a suitable lover in the future.
When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater.

Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that.

It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor.

Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park.

I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports.

In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports.

I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports.

I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports.

I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports.

I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.

From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports.

I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports.

I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor.

Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

As a senior high school student, I am very busy with my studies. Although I am very fond of watching television, I can only spend an hour after dinner on my hobby. Of all the TV programs, I like the news and documentaries best.

Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that. The 23rd day of the last Lunar month is East Day—a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong). It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).

Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Hanoi is famous for typical tropical seasoned place of SouthEast Asia with four seasons: fresh, green and cool in Spring, a bit hot in Summer, fine in the fall and cold in Winter. One things makes my hometown special is that you can meet both contemporary and classical architecture right in the city center. Beside many buildings and shopping center, you can see historical places such as Tran Quoc Pagoda, Hoa Lo Prison, Temple Literature,… Moreover, street food can be found on the main streets of Hanoi, and down many of the side streets and alleyways. You have to try some of the most popular foods in Hanoi, such as: Noodle, Rolled cake, West Lake shrimp cake,… However, one of the main downsides of Hanoi is environmental problems such as air pollution, caused by heavy traffic. Therefore, government builds many parks and plants trees. I love my hometown very much because it is an interesting place to live.
As a senior high school student, I am very busy with my studies. Although I am very fond of watching television, I can only spend an hour after dinner on my hobby. Of all the TV programs, I like the news and documentaries best. The news programs shown on all TV channels at 7:00 p.m. help me to update almost everything about different places in our country and important events happening all over the world. Through these programs, I can also know about the main national and international sporting events. The documentary programs at weekends are my favorites. By watching them, I can learn a great deal about human civilizations, the wonders of nature and the amazing inventions and discoveries of great people in the world. Watching television is my hobby. I cannot imagine a day in my life without watching it.
I usually get up at 7 o'clock in the morning. After washing my face and brushing my teeth, I do morning exercises for ten minutes. Then I have breakfast with my dad at 7:20 and leave home for school at 7:40. My classes start at 8:00 and end at 11:30. After that I come back home, and have lunch with my family at 12:00.

I come back home and have dinner at 7:00 p.m. After dinner, I often watch the news on TV for thirty minutes. Then I prepare for the new lessons and go to bed at 10:30 p.m.
Today, in Vietnam often faced with many natural disasters such as floods, droughts, hail, tropical storms and other natural disasters. These are the most frightening things people are concerned about. Tropical storms often occur and cause most harm. It usually occurs in the rainy season and occurs most often in central Vietnam and coastal areas. It causes a lot of damage to people and property. First, killing people, livestock and poultry by the flood. Second, crop loss due to flooding. Humans become homeless and lose all their possessions. and many other damages caused by the storm. To prevent and fight against tropical storms, before it takes place, we must make preventive dikes, prepare adequate tools and food and other necessities. When storms occur, people must find safe shelters not to go out. After that, we have to overcome what hurricanes destroy, such as rebuilding houses, and many other things, if we live in that area, we should plant trees, protect the environment and many other practical things.
Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that. The 23rd day of the last Lunar month is East Day—a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong). It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien). After that, till the third day or even the fourth day of Tet, individuals meet relatives, friends, and colleagues, wishing them all kinds of good things like happiness, health, and success.
Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.
Each person must have the ideal partner for themselves. For me, my ideal partner is a good heart, honesty, and respect parents, hardworking, and educated. Moreover, she is also a pretty and attractive woman.
Firstly, I love my ideal partner very much because she is enough clever to keep my heart cheerful and always helps me when I need her, especially in my studies.
Besides that, my girlfriend is good heart and responsible when she always reminds me that education is very important because that is what determines our future.Therefore I have to put my education first and when I have problems in studying, we can share with each other to solve together. Last but not least, my woman always respect my parents by greeting them, asking them whenever she helping them in some situations.
For my conclusion, when we want to choose the ideal partner for us, we must know the background of her life and characteristics so that we can choose a suitable lover in the future.
When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention. It is not only the most important factors crucial to the development and survival of a nation, a territory but a junction of trade between regions of countries, cultures on world together. In advanced countries, the situation and development of their traffic is quite developed with a dense transport network and is regulated, but in Vietnam, … Urban transport situation in Vietnam is extremely chaotic. On average there are thousands of cases every year in traffic accidents, causing serious loss of life and property. Despite being upgraded and renovated several times but the transport system of Vietnam has not improved as much. Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention.

Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.

You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

As a senior high school student, I am very busy with my studies. Although I am very fond of watching television, I can only spend an hour after dinner on my hobby. Of all the TV programs, I like the news and documentaries best. The news programs shown on all TV channels at 7:00 p.m. help me to update almost everything about different places in our country and important events happening all over the world.

It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory.

There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.

When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I.

She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.

My hometown is Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam. It is located in Northern Vietnam. It is well known for Vietnam’s largest cultural and political center. Hanoi is famous for typical tropical seasoned place of SouthEast Asia with four seasons: fresh, green and cool in Spring, a bit hot in Summer, fine in the fall and cold in Winter. One things makes my hometown special is that you can meet both contemporary and classical architecture right in the city center. Beside many buildings and shopping center, you can see historical places such as Tran Quoc Pagoda, Hoa Lo Prison, Temple Literature,… Moreover, street food can be found on the main streets of Hanoi, and down many of the side streets and alleyways. You have to try some of the most popular foods in Hanoi, such as: Noodle, Rolled cake, West Lake shrimp cake,… However, one of the main downsides of Hanoi is environmental problems such as air pollution, caused by heavy traffic. Therefore, government builds many parks and plants trees. I love my hometown very much because it is an interesting place to live.
As a senior high school student, I am very busy with my studies. Although I am very fond of watching television, I can only spend an hour after dinner on my hobby. Of all the TV programs, I like the news and documentaries best. The news programs shown on all TV channels at 7:00 p.m. help me to update almost everything about different places in our country and important events happening all over the world. Through these programs, I can also know about the main national and international sporting events. The documentary programs at weekends are my favorites. By watching them, I can learn a great deal about human civilizations, the wonders of nature and the amazing inventions and discoveries of great people in the world. Watching television is my hobby. I cannot imagine a day in my life without watching it.
I usually get up at 7 o'clock in the morning. After washing my face and brushing my teeth, I do morning exercises for ten minutes. Then I have breakfast with my dad at 7:20 and leave home for school at 7:40. My classes start at 8:00 and end at 11:30. After that I come back home, and have lunch with my family at 12:00. After lunch I usually have a short break. I study my lessons​, read books, and do my homework from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. I often play football with my classmates on the ground at 4:30. I come back home and have dinner at 7:00 p.m. After dinner, I often watch the news on TV for thirty minutes. Then I prepare for the new lessons and go to bed at 10:30 p.m.
Today, in Vietnam often faced with many natural disasters such as floods, droughts, hail, tropical storms and other natural disasters. These are the most frightening things people are concerned about. Tropical storms often occur and cause most harm. It usually occurs in the rainy season and occurs most often in central Vietnam and coastal areas. It causes a lot of damage to people and property. First, killing people, livestock and poultry by the flood. Second, crop loss due to flooding. Humans become homeless and lose all their possessions. and many other damages caused by the storm. To prevent and fight against tropical storms, before it takes place, we must make preventive dikes, prepare adequate tools and food and other necessities. When storms occur, people must find safe shelters not to go out. After that, we have to overcome what hurricanes destroy, such as rebuilding houses, and many other things, if we live in that area, we should plant trees, protect the environment and many other practical things.
Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that. The 23rd day of the last Lunar month is East Day—a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong). It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth. On New Year’s Eve, they return home to continue their duties as taking care of families. On New Year’s Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien). After that, till the third day or even the fourth day of Tet, individuals meet relatives, friends, and colleagues, wishing them all kinds of good things like happiness, health, and success.
Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball lessons that I take during summer time. My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do in my free time. Sports are like a part of my life besides other activities, and I will continue to play sports till I am too weak for them.

For my conclusion, when we want to choose the ideal partner for us, we must know the background of her life and characteristics so that we can choose a suitable lover in the future.
When going to school, there are many subjects; however I still like literature the most. First, literature plays an important role in both education and daily life. Literature is not limit to a subject to be learnt at school. Furthermore, this subject teaches human about several aspects of life. From the very first step, student learns to write, read as well as describe things and people. Moreover, literature teaches one to be a responsible citizen and likeable personality. Literature is more than a subject, it’s an art and it can be applied directly into life such as: journalism, editor. People are not born to learn this unique subject, it needs long time to exercise to master. Besides, when learning literature people not only know more works of art but also understand culture, tradition of each country. Literature is the mirror reflecting human and their lifestyle. Studying literature means learning the way to love and live a true life. All in all, with great benefits of literature, it is necessary for each society especially developing countries.
I love a quite strange sport for everyone, and it is ping pong. Not many people in Vietnam who are interested in ping pong, and it is also hard to find a place to actually have enough equipment to play it. Ping pong, or it also known as table tennis, consists of two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table. The table is divided in two halves by a net, and it marks the playing zone of each team. The basic rule for amateurs is pretty simple as players need to let the ball touch their side of the table one time before bouncing back. They then hit the ball back to their opponent’s side with a small paddle, and this time the ball also need to touch the other side of the table as well. A point is counted when a player fail to return back the ball, let it touch the net, or make it land outside of the table. Since it is played on a table, so the area is not big enough for us to wait and think about the next move. Therefore, we need to play it with fast reactions and nonstop motions. We only have one second to act the next step right after hitting the ball, and it does not take much time to complete a set. In a competition, and match usually consists of five or seven sets, and the first one to score 11 points wins a set. Many people do not take this sport serious, but I think it is a very good sport to train both of our physical and mental health as we need to be tough and have quick reactions at the same time.
My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and I. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and I hope that I will inherit some of her traits.
Back in high school, the subject that I really hated was literature. I did not understand why others could write easily but I could not. Honestly, I really admired my friends because they always wrote long essays, and theirs all were full of feelings. When I look back now, I can figure out some reasons. First of all, I belonged to natural science. That was why I always got five scores for literature but maximum ones for math. The second reason was also the most critical factor that impacted negatively on my writing skill. I remember that I had to write unreal things in my essays. For instance, my teachers were not perfect but I had to describe them as angels. How could I write well when the lies always stopped my ideas? In my opinion, this was the worst teaching way because the teachers were killing students' self-expression and teaching their students how to tell lies. Fortunately, I was not good at writing, but I have never failed the exams because I always beat my brains out to finish my essays.
Traffic safety and traffic that the world now needs to pay attention. It is not only the most important factors crucial to the development and survival of a nation, a territory but a junction of trade between regions of countries, cultures on world together. In advanced countries, the situation and development of their traffic is quite developed with a dense transport network and is regulated, but in Vietnam, … Urban transport situation in Vietnam is extremely chaotic. On average there are thousands of cases every year in traffic accidents, causing serious loss of life and property. Despite being upgraded and renovated several times but the transport system of Vietnam has not improved as much. Traffic jams occur repeatedly in large cities damaging hundreds of billion per year, not only that the injuries related to traffic accidents is also increasing, especially head injuries, spine. Circulation of vehicles on roads, railways, waterways each year but with increasing road infrastructure can present data to help the traffic situation.
The karst seascape of Ha Long Bay is one of the world’s most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With the bay’s scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. You should opt for at least an overnight tour to see Ha Long Bay’s iconic views as a day trip doesn’t do it justice. There are plenty of caves in the bay that can be entered including the Hang Sung Sot, with three mammoth caverns, and the Hang Dao Go, with superbly weird stalagmites and stalactites. For most people though, the highlight is simply cruising amid the karsts and soaking up the changing scenery of pinnacles as you pass by.
