1. guide for vs code and compile cryptopp library
- why vs code
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK882S9ESpo
- setting vs code
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp
- compile and include cryptopp in your cpp projects
2. introduction to crytopp library
- Input, output in cryptopp;
- Work with vietnames;
- DES, AES classes;
- Work with large numbers;
3. Modes of operation (block ciphers)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation
- ECB
- CBC
- CBC ciphertext stealing (CTS)
- CFB
- OFB
- counter mode (CTR)
- XTS
- GCM
....
4. Code AES, DES with different modes
- only using standar C++ library
- using cryptopp library
5. Bonus Assignments
 - coding with GUI;
 - encrypt database (sql, nosql) with AES
